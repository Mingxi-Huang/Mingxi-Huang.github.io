I'm from Shenzhen, China, a beautiful and thriving coastal city famous for its technology. Many Chinese IT Titans like Tencent, Huawei, DJI, and PingAn, were all started their story from here.

I graduated from Shenzhen Middle School (which is a high school) in 2017, and went to Cornell University to pursue my Bachlor's Degree (Ithaca, NY, USA). 

I study computer science and operations research at Cornell.
