<p>
    I'm Mingxi Huang, a graduating senior at Cornell University studying Cmoputer Science and minoring in Operations
    Research and Management
    Science.
</p>

<p>
    The passion for computer science carried me through the education at Cornell University, where I got to learn
    algorithms, systems, databases, machine learning, and higher mathematics with great professors and peers, where I
    got many opportunities to practice necessary and advanced skills for software development and data analysis tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Knowing how much there is yet to learn, I plan to pursue a Master's Degree after graduating in May 2021, an MEng
    degree that sharpens my weapon as a software engineer within a compact but fruitful year. Moreover, with two
    software internship experiences in Shenzhen and Beijing, China, I also value the ability to solve real-world
    industrial problems with software and learn new knowledge as I proceed.
