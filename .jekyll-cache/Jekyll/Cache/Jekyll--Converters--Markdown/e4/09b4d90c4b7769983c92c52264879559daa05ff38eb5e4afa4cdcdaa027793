I"U<p>The passion for computer science carried me through the education at Cornell University, where I got to learn algorithms, systems, databases, machine learning, and higher mathematics with great professors and peers, where I got many opportunities to practice necessary and advanced skills for software development and data analysis tasks.</p>

<p>Knowing how much there is yet to learn, I plan to pursue a Masterâ€™s Degree after graduating in May 2021, an MEng degree that sharpens my weapon as a software engineer within a compact but fruitful year. Moreover, with two software internship experiences in Shenzhen and Beijing, China, I also value the ability to solve real-world industrial problems with software and learn new knowledge as I proceed.</p>

<p>Languages: Python, Java, C++
Academic: System Programing, Databases, Machine Learning</p>
